# Maintainers

The Jolie project is maintained by Fabrizio Montesi (see bottom of this page), who coordinates with and relies on a team of (sub)maintainers to make sure that the project evolves coherently and support stakeholders.

Each maintainer is responsible for managing contributions to their domain, ensuring quality, establishing appropriate processes for contributing, and coordinating with the other maintainers for cross-domain issues.

If you wish to contact a maintainer, please try to contact the one that is most specific to your interest.

Do you want to affiliate something that you made with the Jolie project and become a maintainer? [Contact us!](https://github.com/jolie/jolie#get-in-touch)
